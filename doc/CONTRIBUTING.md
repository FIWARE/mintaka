## Pull Request

Since this project uses automatic versioning, please apply one of the following labels to your pull request:
* patch - the PR contains a fix
* minor - the PR contains a new feature/improvement
* major - the PR contains a breaking change

The changes will automatically be released after the PR was merged.

## Bugs & Enhancements

If you find bug or searching for a new feature, please check the [issues](https://github.com/FIWARE/mintaka/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/FIWARE/mintaka/pulls)
first.

### Bug 

If your bug is not already mentioned, please create either a [PR](#pull-request) or a new issue. The issue should contain a brief description on the
observed behaviour, your expectation and a description on how to reproduce it (bonus points if you provide a testcase for reproduction;).

### Enhancement

Create an issue including a proper description for the new feature. You can also start with a PR right away, but it would be easier to align on the details
before and  save unnessary work if discussed before.
